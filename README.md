# Crypt of the NecroDancer - Level Generation

## Overview

This repository contains the current results of my reverse engineering effort of Crypt of the NecroDancer's level generation algorithm. Applications such as replay analysis, AI/TAS, and anything else that requires a matching level generation algorithm are made possible by the implementation. The main goal is to lay a foundation that the Crypt of the NecroDancer community will strongly benefit from.

## Progress

A significant amount of the core algorithm has been implemented. The implementation can currently generate floor 1-1 (seed "1") with full fidelity.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Marukyu, sillypairs, incnone, Worse Than You, Jethrain, and many others for their assistance on this project.
